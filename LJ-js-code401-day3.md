# Learning Journal JS Code 401 - Week 1 - Wednesday

## This week
So far this week, we've been working in Node, focussing on Test Driven Development (TDD) and asychronous functions.

## TDD
Test Driven Development has been all new for me.  It reminds me a little bit of designing equipment when I used to work in pharmaceutical manufacturing.  A common practice is to write up your user requirements first.  What do you want the machine to do, how fast, what level of scrap, what inputs should it use, etc.  Then, you write up the tests it will need to pass to be accepted.  Then, you give that to the machine manufacturer.  They decide how the machine will actually look.  But when they build it and give it back to you, you put it through all the test procedures you've already written.  This is kind of like that, only we are both the tester and the builder.

## Asynch
This is a bit of review from 301, but I'm learning little details as we go.  I'm not sure if it's new content or stuff that I missed in 301.  Either way, it's becoming a lot more clear.
