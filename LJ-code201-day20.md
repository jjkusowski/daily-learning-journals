# Learning Journal Code 201 Week 4 Friday

## Final day of the class
We had finished everything yesterday other than one image that Kat worked on last night.  So that was the only update to our app today.  Not much to report, other than we all worked on what we wanted to say a little more.  And we tested our deployed site a few more times and found that github was giving us an error.  So unfortunately, we had to give our presentation from a local copy, but that was OK.

## Presentation
We were all nervous for our presentation, but I think it went really well.  Everyone seemed to enjoy our site.  And I was blown away by all the other sites from our class.  So many different ideas.  All done so well.

## Thank you
And I know you are reading this Amanda.  Thank you so much for all your help!  Good luck in your career and I hope to see you around Code Fellows!
