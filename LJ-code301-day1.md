# Daily Learning Journal Code 301 Week 1 Monday

## Orientation
This morning started with orientation with Brandy.  She gave a similar talk to the one she did for 201 about bias, inclusivity, and stereotypes.  She's a good speaker with a good and necessary message.  I think she needs to keep it under an hour.

## Morning Lab - ES6
The first lab for the morning was learning the differences between var, let, and const and also template literals.  This one was pretty straight forward, although the instructions in canvas only pointed to the js file.  And the js file only had 1 question in it.  It should have pointed us to the README within the lab files.  Once I found that, it was pretty easy.

## Morning Lab - SMACSS
This one was very confusing.  The article we had to read was not clear at all.  I made some guesses and submitted my work.  I think other people spent a lot more time on it, but I saw the time and wanted to work on the code wars.

## Morning Lab - Code wars
This one ended up being pretty easy, but the Code Wars website is not the most intuitive.

## Lecture
Sam talked about how 301 is going to flow.  Then he talked about MVC - Model View Controller.  Basically, the view is what the user looks at.  The user uses the controller to ask for information.  The controller reaches out to the model to get the info.  The model returns it to the controller.  The controller shows it to the view.

Then Allie talked about Responsive Web Design.  The idea is to make web pages that respond to the device that is looking at it.  

That led to our lab for tomorrow.  Sam introduced it by showing the web page we will be building.  We will have to do all the CSS and then make it have a wide nav bar on a wide screen and a hamburger menu on a phone-sized screen.

And then we found out we also have another Code Wars for tomorrow.

Matt, Garrett and I are teamed up for pair (triplet?) programming.  So we quickly devised a plan to do our whiteboarding.  We got our solution, took pictures, and then headed home.
