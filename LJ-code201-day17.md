# Learning Journal Code 201 Week 4 Tuesday

## Project Week - Day 2 - Start
Today started with a quick meeting with the team.  We had already decided at the end of yesterday what we wanted to work on today. We had made a list of smaller projects and made issues of them in github.  We decided to start together all programing on one computer since we had to flesh out the main constructor and instances on our fight.js file.  All of our smaller tasks depended on that, and the set-up and naming was so important that it was best to do all together.

## Pair programming - morning
After the constructor and instances were set up, we split into pairs to tackle the rest.  We split into different pairs than yesterday to switch things up.  We decided that Matt and I would handle all the buttons and functions associated with the fight itself while Kat and William took on keeping score, local storage, and all the things that happen when a fight is completed.  More or less, Matt and I were responsible for the top of the page while Kat and William did the bottom.

Matt and I did really well together.  Our biggest struggles were around listeners and buttons that didn't do what we thought they should do.  In particular, when we clicked one button, the actions of all four buttons happened.  We changed tactics and got that solved right before lunch.

## Pair programming - afternoon
After lunch, William and I tackled finishing up our listeners and handlers.  Then we moved to the leaderboard.  We had to solve sorting an array of objects to put the leaderboard in order of highest score after new scores are created.  Allie gave us some guidance and it didn't end up being as complicated as we thought.  

Then we got the array of high scores to populate a table and display it on leaderboard.html.  It was similar to salmon cookies, but different enough that we had to do some thinking.  

## End of day
By the end of the day, we had a fully functioning, though basic, web site.  Users can select cats, have a fight, enter their initials, and see the results displayed.  We called this MVP.  I think for our project, MVP was a little easier than some of the other teams, but I'm still proud we got it done by the end of Tuesday, which was our goal.  We now have 2 days to implement some of our crazier stretch goals which are mostly things we've never tried before.  That will be fun and a challenge.  I'm also proud of our teamwork thus far.  And we've done a nice job of stepping away and playing some ping pong to keep ourselves refreshed.
