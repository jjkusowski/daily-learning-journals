# Learning Journal Code 401 Week 7 - Wednesday

## Objectives
In the last week, we've built a couple of apps with React and have started learning Redux

## Most fun
The idea of compartmentalizing everything is really cool.  Store each component in its own file.  Put all the ways to change the state in Reducers and combine them together.  Hold state in a single, easily accessible place.  I can see how this is useful when you have a huge app.

## Least fun
Nothing really.  If I had to pick something, it's the large amount of code we type each day when a relative few lines relate to the new concepts for that day.  I don't see a way around it, but I had to pick something to complain about I guess.  :)
