# Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 6

## Code review
Today for code review, Allie went through the lab work from Friday.  It took me a while to get it on Friday, but today it was a piece of cake.

## Lecture - Domain Modeling
Sam went through the two articles in today's readings about Domain Modeling.  My takeaways were to make sure you define your Domain Problem as best you can, and then solve the problem by breaking it down into as small of problems you can so they are easier to solve piece by piece.

## Lecture - Object Literals
Allie lectured on Objects.  This part I remembered pretty well from 102.

## Lecture - The DOM
I still don't think I quite get this, to be honest.  But the DOM is basically how you get Javascript to look at, interact with, modify, etc the HTML.

## Lab - The cookie store
Lab was quite interesting today.  We had to put together what we learned today about Objects and the DOM.  Both of them were of themselves tricky but together was even harder.  The hardest part about objects for me is keeping all the syntax straight, especially when there are a lot of objects involved.  I got a little sideways today when I had everything working, and then made some changes and not everything was referencing each other properly or methods weren't being called.
