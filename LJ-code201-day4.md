# Learning Journal Code 201 - Day 4

## Code review
Code review was a little different today.  Instead of going through some of the students' homework, Sam walked us through some possible solutions to yesterday's homework on For and While loops.  His solutions were more elegant than mine which I suppose is to be expected.  He makes it so easy.  Some day.

## Lecture - CSS
Sam lectured on CSS.  I can't even remember what it was about other than I have a lot of practice to do.

## Lecture - Functions
This part I got.  Functions are easy (so far).

## Git cloning and forks
In prep for pair programming, Sam and Allie showed us how to make a fork in Github and how to upload changes and get them back to the owner.

## Lab - Pair programming
For lab today, we were introduced to pair programming.  Or in our case, triplet programming.  The 3 Jeffs were made into a group.  We worked well together as a team.  The assignment itself wasn't all that hard.  We had some code clean-up to do and we hit a couple issues caused by typos that were hard to track down.  But overall, it went well.
