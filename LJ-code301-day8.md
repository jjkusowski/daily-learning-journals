#Learning Journal Code 301 Week 2 Wednesday
## Lab
Today's lab was a walkthrough of setting up a server.js file.  A lot of it was laid out pretty plainly for us, so the work was not in the coding itself, but in understanding the code itself.  This was our first time with this, so the difficulty level was appropriate.  Andrew and I finished in just under 2 hours.

## Lecture
Today's lecture expanded on the server code.  Allie did code review on that morning's lab.  I learned a lot more as we talked through it.

Sam then took us through some slides on SQL.  I think that makes sense since the readings and tutorial we did in preparation was really done well.  And the concepts are not that hard.

Finally, Sam walked us through some much more difficult server script.  Our lab for tomorrow is going to be to go through it and comment on what everything is doing.

## CodeWars
Today's code wars was to take an array of strings and return it as a string formed into a phrase with comma's and "and" in the appropriate places.
