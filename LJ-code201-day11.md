# Daily Learning Journal Code 201 Week 3 Monday

## Code Review
Allie did code review today.  We looked at the chocolate pizza lab from Friday.  We did pretty well, but I learned how to put in horizontal lines like were on the header and footer of that assignment.

## Prep for the week
Allie and Sam talked about the end of this week when we will get put into teams and can start working on our team projects.

## Demo and lab prep
Sam walked us through a clicking demo in preparation for our lab this week.  And, he showed us his working version of the lab.

## Lab
Lab this week is to take 20 given images, display 3 at a time, and allow a user to click on one.  The clicks should be tallied.  And when the user has clicked 25 times, display how many each has been clicked.  I got it done in about 4 hours, but the CSS is messing with me again.  :(
