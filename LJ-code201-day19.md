# Learning Journal Code 201 Week 4 Thursday

## Morning
We left yesterday with our site basically working and a few stretch goals done.  The main tasks for today were getting the sprite animations in the correct position, getting content into our About Us page, and making the stats of our cats different from one another.  William got back to sprites for most of the day.  Matt and I got the cats differentiated.  Matt and I got part of the About Us done.  Kat made tweeks to CSS and images.

## Afternoon
William got the sprites finished.  I got the images on the About Us inserted.  Matt added links to our contact info.  Kat did code clean-up. We pushed to gh-pages and worked on our presentation.
