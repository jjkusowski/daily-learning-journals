# Learning Journal Code 301 Week 3 Wednesday

## Lab
Garrett and I came in with renewed energy.  We were still working on completing the tasks in yesterday's lab. Around 11, we got the Book.all to populate.  Then it took us until about 1:30 to debug a typo in our handlebars that was keeping it from rendering to the DOM. Hi-5's ensued.  Felt great, even though we were a day behind.  

## Lecture - Code Review
JB took us through Code Review.  The day 1 stuff now makes sense.  I think the day 2 stuff makes sense, too, but we haven't started it yet, so we will find out soon enough.

## Lecture - Middleware and Environments
Sam lectured on two topics.  First, was a picture showing where middleware intersects with our lab.  Easy enough.  Then, we continued filling in the table he made showing the differences between development, staging, and production.

Sam then brought up the finished product of the old Kilovolt blog from last week.  It now has pagesJS functionality.  Then he took us on a journey through the evolution of that code.  Basically, which methods and files were added each day of the class.  He then previewed all the views that our current app will have by the end of the week.  Sam is going to push the Kilovolt blog code for us to see.

## Lecture - Lab preview
Allie demo'd an Admin page that requires a passphrase to enter.  That will be our lab for tomorrow.  She published the lab and off we went.
