# Daily Journal Code 201 Week 4 Wednesday

## Morning
I spent most of the day working with William and Matt on getting sprites to work.  The morning was mostly research and frustration.  We did most of our work in Code Pen.  A lot of what we found was either jqueery (so we couldn't understand it) or was done in CSS (which we didn't want to do).  We finally found an example late in the morning that was close enough to what we wanted to do so we could learn from it.

## Afternoon
After lunch, I did some quick work on event listeners on the index page after we discovered that they were listening to a much larger area than we wanted and would give some bad inputs if you didn't click on a character.  It was a lot like Allie's goat demo that allowed you to click on a <section> that wasn't a goat.  I followed her solution and got it to work.

Then William and I plowed back into sprites.  Slowly but surely we got there and we had a major breakthrough right at the end of the day.  We know what we need to do to finish the sprites in the morning.
