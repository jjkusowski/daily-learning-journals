# Learning Journal Code 401 Week 7 - Wednesday

## Objectives
In the last week, we've continued to work with React/Redux and added the complexity of connecting them to a backend.

## Most fun
I like working with our mid-project backend.  It's hard to connect a front-end, but I'm learning a lot.

## Least fun
Jumping around through new codebases every day is hard.  It feels like we haven't finished any of the apps.  ToDo list, budget tracker, and now our mid-project. I wish we finished something.
