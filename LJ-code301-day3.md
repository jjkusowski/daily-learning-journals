# Learning Journal Code 301 Week 1 Wednesday

## Morning - Lab
Joy and I were paired together today.  She didn't feel well, but she was still a rockstar.

Our lab today was to use Javascript to build a constructor function using data from a given array of objects.  And then use jQuery to post data from the objects to HTML.

We encountered a few problems, including an infinite loop written into the starter code.  But we got it done in about 2.5 hours.

## Morning - Free time
I was able to get the reading done for tomorrow since we got done with lab early.

## Afternoon - Lecture
### Code Review - Allie, JB, and Sam
We reviewed the code for today's lab.  It was pretty similar to what Joy and I did, though a little simpler, especially with how she called $newArticle over and over while we monkey'd around with using :last.

### jQuery Events - Allie
Allie walked us through jQuery events with a demo.  This is an improvement on using vanilla javascript event listeners.  The demo also had tab-based navigation.  Finally, she showed us a drop down menu that displayed ice cream.

### Lab Prep - Sam
Sam showed us the lab for tomorrow and how it will work.  We need to add drop-down menus to select articles by author or category.  We will also add tabbed navigation to switch between the articles tab and About Me.

### Code Wars
I was paired with Adrian.  We whiteboarded up a solution to a problem where we had to take in a multidigit number.  We had to return a string that had a dash between any consecutive odd numbers.  I solved it when I got home with a solution that was pretty close to what we had whiteboarded.
