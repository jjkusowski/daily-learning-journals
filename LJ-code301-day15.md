# Learning Journal Code 301 Week 3 Friday

## Morning Lecture
Today was a little unusual in that we had a morning lecture.  Sam took us through how to get and use a token to access API's.  We did a short lab where we got a token to access data from our own github account and set up a webpage that accesses it.  We buried the token in our Heroku environment variables so that no one could see it.  

## Lab
Garrett and I continued work on the book app.  We got put and delete working.

## Afternoon lecture
Afternoon lecture was helping people debug their book app (Joy and Joe).  And then we talked about Project week.  I'm on a team with Matt I., Ariel, and Phalen.

# Late Lab
Garrett and I continued work on admin.  We were close, but gave up for the night.
