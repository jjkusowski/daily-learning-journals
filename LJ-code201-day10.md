# Daily Learning Journal Code 201 Friday Week 2

## Code Review 
This morning we mostly went through the CSS demo on Code Pen.  It really helped me understand CSS. I'm still behind a lot of others, but I'm getting there.

## Lunch and Learn
The speaker talked about transitioning from a dev to a manager.  He was very interesting and you could tell why he was a successful manager.

## Lab
Lab was cool today.  Only because I got to work with Nick, though.  I do not like styling.  But Nick did a lot of it and I got to do the other stuff.  We were a good pair.

Weekend, yay!
