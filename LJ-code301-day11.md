# Learning Journal Code 301 Week 3 Monday

## Lab
Lab was a continuation of the homework we had over the weekend.  I struggled to get the lab done and was thankful for more time to work on it.  The syntax of filter, map, and reduce were difficult.  I can get them individually, but putting them all together was a struggle.  I finally got that.  I was not able to get the handlebars to display the authors and words.  I was close by lecture time, but it turns out I just had a typo.  I had forgotten the ```#``` selector.

## Code Review
JB did code review on the difficult lab.  His solutions were more concatetenated than mine.  On top of stringing all his methods together, he also used fat arrow functions.  I get it when I see it, but writing it is still difficult.  I was also able to catch my typo and resubmit my homework.

## Sam stuff
I don't know what to call this section but Sam expanded on the MVC model we had been using.  We've been hosting our client and server side code in the same place.  This week, we will learn it works in the real world, in different places.  And he talked about Heroku.  We had homework on that.  Heroku is a place to host server files and the server interaction with a database.  It can also host the database.

## Demo/ lab introduction
Allie did a demo of a task list.  For lab this week, we will be building a list of books.  The two will be very similar.  She went through all the steps that we will be going through to set up our server on Heroku.

## Code Wars
Code Wars is a puzzle where we have to take in an array of somethings, cube any numbers that are odd, and add those results together.  Sounds like a good use of filter, map, and reduce, which is good practice on one of the things I struggled with in today's lab.
