# Learning Journal Code 301 Project Week Thursday

## Morning
This morning we worked on finalizing our app.  The major projects were adding and touching up images and styling the results page.  Somehow I ended up working on images though I'm not particularly skilled at it, but I think they turned out pretty good.  We also did code clean-up throughout the day.

## Afternoon
We didn't finish the styling of the results page in the morning, so Phelan took on finishing that.  One of the hard things on a single page app is that there's only so many files to work on.  So to prevent merge conflicts there's really only one person that can work on it at a time.  So I touched up the images a little more.  Ariel worked on a stretch goal add a button that re-sorts the events by date that it started, rather than the default alphabetical.  It works really nice.  We also spent probably too much time coming up with punny character names for ourselves and I don't regret it one bit.

Finally, we finished up and it works and looks really nice!
