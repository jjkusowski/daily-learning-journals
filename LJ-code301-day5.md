# Learning Journal Code 301 Week 1 Friday
## Lab
Today I was paired with Catherine.  She was an awesome partner.  She usually sits behind me during lecture, but we've never worked together, so this was fun.
This was the easiest lab of the week.  We used Handlebars.js to refactor the templates in our code.  It only took us about an hour.

## 401 javascript final presentations
Since I had time, I was able to catch all the presentations.  I was especially impressed with the group that got their idea from challenge.org and built a site to get help for overdose victims.  

## Partner Power Hour
The presenter this week was a UX expert from Amazon.  She knew her stuff.  My takeaway was that UX is not a singular thing that you do, but a process to understand the problem domain, brainstorming, prototyping, testing, and iteration.

## Lecture - Code Review
I had a revelation about the difference between prototype methods and methods that are properties of objects.  That was 3 weeks in the making.

## Lecture - New Lab
The new lab for the weekend is to create a form to enter new blog articles.  We got a lot of it done in class and have to finish it up before lecture on Monday.
