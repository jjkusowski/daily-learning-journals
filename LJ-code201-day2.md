# LJ Code 201 - Day 2

## Code Review
We started the day with Allie leading us through our first code review.  Adrian volunteer his code from our previous day's lab.  Good review to start our day.

## Lecture
Sam took us through the day's lectures.  The topics were:
- Convention for Quotes and Case
- Separation of Concerns
- Hierarchy

That stuff all made sense.  For now.  Definitely don't have it down cold, but I wasn't lost.

## Git and GitHub practice
We did some practice on Git and GitHub.  ACP!!!!  It finally all made sense.  I messed up a few times, got lost in a VIM (Later permanently fixed), and had to delete some stuff and start over.  Later, I added a READ.ME file to one of my repos and it screwed everything up.  Dustin (The TA) helped straighten me out.

## Lab practice
Sam started us off on our lab.  The goal is to make 5 yes/no questions about ourselves.  Sam got us through question 1, taught us the .toLowerCase() method, and the difference between === and ==.  We also learned about truthy and falsey.

## lab
I worked on the lab.  Took me maybe 20 minutes.  Seemed hard when I first read through it, but after Sam's help, it was pretty easy.
