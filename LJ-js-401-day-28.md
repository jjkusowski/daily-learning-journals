# Learning Journal Code 401 Week 6 - Wednesday

## Objectives
Last week, we had our mid-project which was back-end only and this week we started working with React.

## Most fun
Hard to decide between project week and React.  I think we turned what can be kinda dull (a back-end only project) into something fun.  But React has been pretty wild.  It's so different.  Hard to wrap your head around at times.  But 99% of it makes sense once you understand what you're supposed to do.  I'm excited to learn more.

## Least fun
All the sick people.  Even my daughter was throwing up last week.  Luckily (knock on wood) I've only gotten a small cold so far.  The instructional staff have done a great job keeping the bus moving forward considering most of them have gotten it pretty bad.  But I have to say I will be happy when everyone is back at 100% health.
