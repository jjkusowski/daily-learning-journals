# Learning Journal Code 401 Week 2 - Wednesday

## Objectives
Over the last week, we've learned about binary data, linked lists, TCP servers and HTTP servers.  A big topic within that is Promises.

## Most fun
I think the most fun has actually been writing tests.  At first it was cumbersome, and I'm sure it will get that way again.  But for the last lab it made it really easy to know which code I needed to write or fix if I had written a good test first.

## Least fun
Understanding the homework.  The objectives of some of the labs are unclear.  For example, on the cowsay lab, it wasn't clear that the POST method was supposed to return the image of the cow and not just the message you sent in.  In retrospect, it makes sense to return the cow image because otherwise it would be pointless for a user.  Perhaps this is how it was supposed to be so we get used to confusing instructions in the real world and we ask questions.  We asked Vinicio to show us working applications before we start our lab so we know what we are working towards and I hope he does that.
