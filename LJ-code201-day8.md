# Daily Learning Journal  201 Wednesday, Day 8

## Code Review
Allie reviewed Andrew's cookie store table. Main takeaways were how to use prototypes and how to cleanly layout code.

## Lecture - Events
Allie lectured on Events.  She demo'd click events incrementing a counter.

## Lecture - Forms
Sam lectured on Forms.  He did a demo showing a chat webpage to show how event listening and forms work.  A little confusing at that point.

## Lab
We have to add a way to add a store to our sales.html webpage.
