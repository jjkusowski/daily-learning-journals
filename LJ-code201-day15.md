# Learning Journal Code 201 Friday Week 3

## LAST DAY OF LECTURES!!

## Announcements-Discussion
Final exam is this weekend.  Take your time.  Use all resources.  Don't stress out.  
Go listen to 301 presentations.
Lab today is a ~1 hour git conflict practice.
Homework resubmits are due by Sunday midnight.

## Code Review
Allie took us through Joy and Jeff's shopping cart lab.  This is the dumbest I've felt in a while as this code is so above and beyond anything I thought of.  It's so good.
Then we looked at Catherine and Seth's and theirs was very good, too, but more at the level that my team was at.

## Lecture - Review
Allie opened up to the group to allow review of any topics we've covered.  We went over JSON, CSS positioning, and some other stuff.

## Lecture - 301 Preview
Sam went through a list of topics, but it kinda came down to dealing with remote data and dispaying it in the browser.  He talked a while regarding Abstraction.

## Final Project Documents and Planning
High level roadmap and all the associated documents to help us.

## Lab Preview
Merge conflict exercise with your project team.

## Lab and Team work
We worked as a team through the merge conflict lab.  Then we worked on project ideas.  I think we've decided on a cat fighting game.  We assigned some tasks for the weekend and then called it a day.
