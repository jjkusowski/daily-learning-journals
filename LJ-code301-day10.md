# Learning Journal Code 301 Week 2 Friday

## Lab
Today I worked with Dre.  First time working with him, but we've talked soccer a lot, so I feel like I already knew him.  Lab got off to a rough start with technical issues.  He recently had his Mac stolen from his car and he was using a pc he hadn't used before.  It wouldn't connect to his postgres server.  Weird.  We ended up doing the whole lab on my MacBook.  

The objective of the lab was to write code in a server.js file that writes queries to an SQL database.  We did pretty well.  Some of the syntax was a little difficult.  Dre and I worked well together and corrected each other's mistakes.

## Lecture
The 401 .NET and 401 Javascript instructors came in and talked to us to help us decide which 401 we wanted to take.  It helped me make my decision as I'm 99% sure I want Javascript.

Allie did code review on the solution to today's lab.  The server stuff is slowly sinking in.

JB introduced .map(), .filter(), and .reduce(). 

Sam introduced the new lab which we will do individually over the weekend.
