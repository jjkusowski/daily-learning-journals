# Learning Journal Code 301 Week 2 Monday
## Lab
Today's lab was to build a wireframe using HTML and Javascript.  We were given two png files that it should match.  One was a mobile view and the other a desktop view.  The page needed to be responsive when widening and narrowing the window and snap to a mobile view when below 800px wide.

## Lecture
Today was about JSON and AJAX.  It was pretty high level and then we got down to details of our lab tomorrow.  We will have to update the blog we've been using to take JSON data from a given file and populate our blog articles. 

## CodeWars
We have to take in an array of 4 numbers.  Each number must be either one greater or one lesser than another number in the array.  If that's true, return true.  If not, return false.  I can pass the sample tests but not all the tests and I'm not sure why.  I'll have to work on it in the morning.
