# Learning Journal Code 301 Project Week Friday

## Morning
Everyone was in early and we made a few last tweeks to the styling.  Nothing major.  Then we watched the 401 javascript and .NET projects.  Some cool stuff.

## Afternoon
We presented last in our group.  I enjoyed all the other teams.  Our class does such cool stuff.  I think our presentation went well and people enjoyed our app.

That was a fun class.  On to 401!
