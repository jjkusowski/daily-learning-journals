# Learning Journal Code 401 Week 3 - Wednesday

## Objectives
Over the last week, we've learned about persistance, doubly linked lists, stacks, queues, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose.

## Most fun
Just like last week, I'm still liking tests.  I also like that we are finding libraries to simplify our work flows.  And in a weird way, the most enjoyable part of the past week was that my code didn't work for the longest time on Monday night into Tuesday.  And the solution was just adding some returns.  But while I worked through that, I caused all sorts of havok in my code and broke a bunch of other stuff, but I ended up learning a lot that way.  For example, I think I really understand how promises work, and particularly how they work in tests written with jest.  

## Least fun
This is a tough one.  It's been a good week.  But I decided to do my learning journals this way, so I have to pick something.  The feeling of helplessness when I had tests passing even though I knew they should fail wasn't very fun.  (Though I figured out why and that was cool and a good learning.)  Maybe that momentary feeling during whiteboard challenges when I have no idea how to solve the problem.  But that's something I either need to outgrow or learn to embrace.  Either way, the practice is great.  (And Ron, if you're reading this, it looks like a ton of extra work to grade those, so thank you.)
