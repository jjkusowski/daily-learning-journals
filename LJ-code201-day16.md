# Learning Journal 201 Week 4 Monday
# Start of project week

## Project definition
My team is Kat, William, Matt I. and me.  We are building a player vs player, turn-based fighting game to be played in a browser.  

## My contributions
I did the scaffolding for one of the pages (fight.html) and then contributed multiple times to the javascript for the index page.  My main contribution to that was solving how to prompt player 1 to choose a character, save that character, prompt player 2, save that character, save those two characters to local storage and direct the browser to fight.html.

## Overnight assignment
Find a picture of a cat to be a fighter.
