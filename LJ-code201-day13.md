# Daily Learning Journal CF 201 Week 3 Wednesday

## Final Project Planning
Sam showed us some previous 201 final projects.  He seemed to have selected projects that looked good at first, but had some obvious errors after further inspection.  Gave us all something to think about as we figure out what we want to do.

## Code Review
Today for code review, we looked at Matt's Bus Mall.  I liked how he got his images centered vertically.  It was a lot better than what I had, so I updated my code with that style later.  Looks the same as my work-around, but I actually understand it and it's cleaner.  We also looked at Rob's work on getting an event listener to work on the chart.

## Persistance
We learned about local storage and how to get data onto the computer of the user.  That way, we can store settings and other info so the user doesn't lose everything they've entered when they refresh.  One big takeaway is that everything is stored as a string.  So we learned about JSON.stringify and JSON.parse.

## Lab
Today's lab is to add persistant memory to the votes on the Bus Mall.  I had it working, then I didn't, and then I did.  Pretty cool.
